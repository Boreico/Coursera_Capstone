## Introduction

In this project I will try to create machine learning model that could predict, does some weather conditions will lead to road accident with the injured. Model of similar type could be used by emergency services for provisional allocation of ambulance teams in specific regions.

In context of this problem False Negative outputs are more unwanted than False Positive, because the cost of FN output may be human life. Therefore I will try to crate **recall-oriented** ML model.
